Module 6 - Validate Model Data

Required npm modules: dotenv express body-parser mongoose express-validator ejs

This is a web app that will create a server and open a connection to a MongoDB collection

On the home page you can create a new user, retrieve a user, update, and delete user documents

User details are validated based on criteria such as valid email address, minimum age (18+), name length longer than 2 characters etc

Invalid details will return an error stating what did not validate into the console log

To create a user click the signup link
To retrieve click the lookup link
To update click the edit link
To delete click the delete link

/home is the landing page with links to the CRUD functions in case you get stuck, usually it should return you back to the home page if an error happens
